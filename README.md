This project is an analysis of the average monthly sea ice extent (area) in Baffin Bay from October 1978 through February 2020 to identify and characterize any trends (seasonality, yearly drift) and predict the sea ice extent in future years. It was completed to fulfill the requirements for ACMS 60855 Spatio-Temporal Statistics for Environmental Applications at the University of Notre Dame.

The project is contained in MilikichMidterm1.R, and can be run by simply executing this one file. Also included in this repository is 'Milikich Midterm 1.pdf', which is a fuller report on the methodology and conclusions of this analysis.

Running this code requires that the R packages ggplot2 and forecast be installed.

To run the source code, the following should be included in the same directory (included in this repository):
- SeaIce.RData

This project was run using R version 4.0.3.
